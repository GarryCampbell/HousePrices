# HousePrices

Playing around with a Kaggle dataset

## Version 1

The aim of this version is to figure out how to download data straight from Kaggle and get something quick working. 

I used a linear regression model straight from SKLearn to predict the house prices. 
I didn't bother testing the model on the test set in the end. 

## Version 2

The aim of this version is to create a linear regression model from scratch. 
Don't really care about results - just want to make a model without any packages. 
Again, I will be removing any nominal data in the dataset. 
Might make a model later that uses the entire dataset.
